## Introduction:

In the rapidly evolving world of produce, avocados stand out not just for their nutritional value but for the complex market dynamics they embody. The journey of avocados from farm to table involves navigating a landscape shaped by regional preferences, seasonal fluctuations, and broader market forces. As avocado consumption continues to rise globally, understanding and effectively managing the factors that influence their pricing is crucial for anyone involved in the avocado supply chain—from growers to distributors, retailers, and even consumers.

This project, “Navigating Avocado Pricing: A Strategic Approach to Regional, Seasonal, and Predictive Insights,” aims to dissect the intricate patterns of avocado pricing and sales from 2015 to 2023. By leveraging data from the Hass Avocado Board, we will explore how different regions, seasons, and market conditions influence the pricing of avocados. The ultimate goal is to develop a strategic framework that not only explains historical trends but also provides actionable predictions and insights for future pricing strategies, ensuring that stakeholders can navigate the avocado market with greater confidence and precision.

## Problem Statement:

Effectively managing avocado pricing requires a comprehensive understanding of the various factors that drive market dynamics. Regional variations, seasonal trends, and predictive modeling all play vital roles in determining the final price of avocados. This project aims to analyze data from 2015 to 2023 to uncover how geography, seasonality, and economic events influence avocado prices and sales volumes. The insights gained from this analysis will empower stakeholders to make informed and strategic pricing decisions, ultimately optimizing the supply chain and ensuring sustained success in the market.

## Key Features

Data Analysis: Regional, seasonal, and product-type trends.
Exploratory Insights: Price sensitivity, consumer packaging preferences, and long-term sales stability.
Machine Learning: Model-driven predictions for avocado sales volumes, optimizing decision-making.
Recommendations: Strategic guidance for stakeholders based on market insights.

## Setting Up the Coding Environment

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:
bash

git clone [https://github.com/keneilweRangw/Mastering-Avocado-Prices.git]

2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using pip:
bash

cd price_df
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Activate the environment for which you want to export the package list using the conda activate <environment_name> command.

4. Run the following command to generate a text file containing the list of installed packages:
conda list --export > environment.txt

5. Then add this environment.txt file to your GitHub repository and commit the changes. This will allow others to see the list of packages and recreate the environment using the conda create --name <env_name> --file environment.txt command.
   
## Creating a branch

- *Push New Branch to Remote Repository*: Use the git push command followed by the name of the remote repository (origin by convention) and the name of the local branch you want to push. If the branch doesn't exist on the remote repository yet, Git will create it for you:
   
   git push origin feature-branch
   
-  *Authenticate (if prompted)*: If this is the first time pushing to the remote repository or if you haven't authenticated previously, Git may prompt you to enter your credentials (username and password) for the remote repository.

- *Verify on Remote Repository*: After pushing the branch, you can verify that it has been created on the remote repository by visiting the repository's page on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub) in a web browser

- *Make Changes to Your Project Files*: Using jupyter notebook

- *Check Status*: use the git status command to see which files have been modified:
   
   git status
   
- *Add and Commit Changes*: If you're happy with the changes you've made, you can add them to the staging area and commit them using the following commands:
   
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"

- *Repeat as Needed*:  repeat this process as many times as necessary until you're satisfied with your changes and ready to push them to the remote repository.

- *Push Changes (if necessary)*:push the changes to the remote repository using the git push command:
   
   git push origin <branch_name>
   
## Datasets
Accessing Data: The project may require access to Avocado_HassAvocadoBoard_20152023v1.0.1.csv. Ensure that you have the required datasets stored in a directory accessible to the project.
Run the Code: Once dependencies are installed and data is accessible, you can run the main script to perform data analysis and generate insights:
css

python main.py

Explore Results: After running the code, explore the generated results, including visualizations and analysis reports, to gain insights into Avocado pricing trends.
